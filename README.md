This repo will be used for discussing and prioritizing collaboration topics.

Hello, World!

**Harold says:**

Here is the list of topics from my previous email:

Next to practicing Pair-Programming on the tasks on your road map, I could think of

* Refactoring/clean up of your projects
* Setting up or improving continuous integration builds
* Setting up static code analysis and auto formatting
* Performance profiling and tuning
* unit/integration testing, or TDD

**Theo says:**

Sounds good. Here are some double-clicks:

* Creating a workflow for maintaining amd re-imagining dozens of small projects
* Setting up more and better linting
* Designing tests for 3D
* Tricks for keeping to 60 fps

And while we are at it, here are some of my personal, quite eccentric guidelines

## My guidelines

* All versions of a web page present and past are runnable and viewable in your browser
* All code may be generated, run and tested using on Windows Notepad as your IDS running offline
* All code is plain vanilla JavaScript with few if any dependencies
* All code is designed for easy reading, very simple algorithms a pleasing appearance
* All code can be read and re-mixed by beginners AND by Rust developrs AND by Abgular developers

I am a designer, not a programmer. Mostly I build what I call "demos". Generally these are small proof-of-cencept efforts. Once you have run the demo and seen the code, you cannot "un-see". You can do it too, What I hope is that you take what I build and remix it and embed the ideas in the projects you are working on and having fun with.
